# SOC'25 - THE EYES OF THE MACHINE : A JOURNEY INTO FACE DETECTION
## Overview
This is my project that I took up under the "Summer of Code - 2025" program conducted by the Web and Coding Club, IIT Bombay.

Duration: 24th May'25 - 14th July'25

## Workflow of the Project
Firstly, I revised my CS101 course slides to get the grasp on some basic algorithm to keep them in mind while making the project. The slides are added in the repositry for reference.

Then next, I learned the Python language which is required for the project. The link for the playlists for learning Python are :-

1) [English] - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3&feature=shared
2) [Hindi] - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agwh1XjRt242xIpHhPT2llg&si=CPyWe_9dVjotUk7s

Then learned the Python modules mainly the three libraries which are NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. The document for learning Python modules is [here](https://github.com/Jayent-Dev-1232/SOC-25---Facial-Recognition/blob/main/Python_libraries_doc.docx).

I will be using ***Siamese Neural Network*** architecture in this project (though it is also a CNN model, we will not be using advanced Pre-Processing or activation functions). I also will be needing Tensorflow and OpenCV opensource libraries for the project. The link for the pdf for the ***Siamese Neural Network*** is [here](https://github.com/Jayent-Dev-1232/SOC-25---Facial-Recognition/blob/main/Siamese_Neural_Network.pdf).
